IOS APP designed for Iphone which uses a waterproof case for the phone and 3d printed wheel with a magnet to measure lines in underwater caves.

Concept:
The app uses the magnetometer to detect the proximity of a magnet on a wheel.
The wheel is clamped around the cave diving line and rotates as the diver moves the device forward.
Each rotation the app detects the peak magnetic field value and by knowing the diameter/circumference of the wheel masures the distance traveled along the line.

The app then saves a data point each rotation with the following data: point number, compass heading, distance ( total from the first point ), depth ( user can adjust via 2 buttons on the dive case ).

The app has also manual points which are added by the diver on each tieoff point.

The survey data can be exported in CSV and shared via IOS share opitons.

There is also option to view a live map for reference during the dive.
